<p>I've always been an over-achiever.  Work hard, and see how far you can go.  From a tiny, rural high school, I went to Caltech.  After graduation, I finished a PhD in only 4 years.  And when it came time to start a family, I went all in.  Six children in 8 years, while my husband taught high school.  I homeschooled the children and ran a farm with cows, goats, turkeys, and 150 chickens.  I sold shares of our flock to start an egg CSA.  </p>

<p>Now that the children are older, it makes more sense to have the teacher teach the children and the scientist go to work.  My thesis work developed Rietveld (least-squares) analysis procedures to determine preferred orientations (texture) of mineral crystals in rocks.  I worked with both image and text data taken from several different sources.  I loved taking in large amounts of data in often difficult formats and turning it into useful information.  It might take months of analysis and modeling to create a single graphic, but that graphic could show the strain history across an entire region.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/grace-pehl/">This GitHub site</a> chronicles my growing knowledge of data science.  I am concurrently enrolled in the Data Analyst Nanodegree from Udacity and the specialization in data science offered by Johns Hopkins University and Coursera.  I plan to complete both programs in November.  I will also complete the specialization in project management through UC, Irvine in August and plan to take the CAPM exam afterwards. </p>
