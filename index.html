<p>I've always been an over-achiever.  Work hard, and see how far you can go.  From a tiny, rural high school, I went to Caltech.  After graduation, I finished a PhD in only 4 years.  And when it came time to start a family, I went all in.  Six children in 8 years, while my husband taught high school.  I homeschooled the children and ran a farm with cows, goats, turkeys, and 150 chickens.  I sold shares of our flock to start an egg CSA.  </p>

<p>Now that the children are older, it makes more sense to have the teacher teach the children and the scientist go to work.  My thesis work developed Rietveld (least-squares) analysis procedures to determine preferred orientations (texture) of mineral crystals in rocks.  I worked with both image and text data taken from several different sources.  I loved taking in large amounts of data in often difficult formats and turning it into useful information.  It might take months of analysis and modeling to create a single graphic, but that graphic could show the strain history across an entire region.</p>

<p>This site chronicles my growing knowledge of data science.  I am concurrently enrolled in the Data Analyst Nanodegree from Udacity and the specialization in data science offered by Johns Hopkins University and Coursera.  I am also working on a capstone in project management through UC, Irvine and studying to take the CAPM exam. </p>

 <h1 id="projects" class="project-name">Data Science Projects</h1>
 <h2 class="project-tagline"><a href="grace-pehl.github.io/enron">Identifying Fraud from Enron Email</a></h2><p>Using the Enron Corpus and public financial data, compared Random Forest and AdaBoost at identifying Persons of Interest.  I also got an introduction to text learning by stemming and vectorizing email text and training a classifier to select between two email authors.</p>
 <h2 class="project-tagline"><a href="gracepehl.shinyapps.io/LondonMap">Interactive Crime Map of London Boroughs</a></h2><p>Visualized data from the London Data Store as an app in R and deployed the app on the Shiny server </p>
 <h2 class="project-tagline"><a href="rpubs.com/grace-pehl/londoncrime">London Crime Map Presentation</a></h2><p></p>Created a brief HTML5 slide deck in R describing the London crime map app.</p>
 <h2 class="project-tagline"><a href="grace-pehl.github.io/MLworkout">Classifying Workout Quality from Personal Accelerometer</a></h2><p>Trained and tested a random forest algorithm on accelerometer records taken from subjects performing bicep curls to identify problems in technique.</p>
 <h2 class="project-tagline"><a href="http://rpubs.com/grace-pehl/prosper">Exploratory Data Analysis of Prosper Loans</a></h2><p>Project 4 of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree.  Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis performed in a stream-of-consciousness style Rmarkdown file.</p>
 <h2 class="project-tagline"><a href="http://rpubs.com/grace-pehl/mtcars">Linear Regression Model for Mtcars</a></h2><p>Developed a linear regression model for fuel economy using R's mtcars dataset.  Rather than rely soley on R-squared and variance inflation factors, I did some research on cars to develop a more physical model.</p>
 <h2 class="project-tagline"><a href="http://rpubs.com/grace-pehl/tooth">Statistical Comparisons using T-Tests and Confidence Intervals</a></h2><p>Quick comparisons using t-tests and confidence intervals with R's ToothGrowth dataset.</p>
 <h2 class="project-tagline"><a href="http://rpubs.com/grace-pehl/statinf1">Statistical Inference Simulation Exercise</a></h2><p>An exercise to illustrate the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of a sample statistic is normal with mean equal to the population statistic it estimates and variance equal to the square of the standard error (population variance divided by sample size). Uses R to perform 1000 simulations of drawing 40 random numbers from an exponential distribution with lambda = 0.2. Calculates a sample mean for each simulation and demonstrates that they are normally distributed.</p>
 <h2 class="project-tagline"><a href="http://rpubs.com/grace-pehl/stormdata">Exploratory Analysis of NOAA Storm Database</a></h2><p>The second project for Reproducible Research was a chance to play with the National Weather Service's Storm Database.  The question was simply which types of weather event cause the most damage and risk to human life.  The analysis was complicated by dirty data.  There were almost 500 unique entries for the type of weather event.</p>
 <h2 class="project-tagline"><a href="http://rpubs.com/grace-pehl/activity">Descriptive Analysis of Personal Activity Data, Oct-Nov 2012</a></h2><p>This project was the first peer assessment for Reproducible Research, the fifth course in the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization. This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012 and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.</p>
 <h2 class="project-tagline"><a href="http://grace-pehl.github.io/OpenStreetMaps/">Wrangling OpenStreetMaps data into MongoDB</a></h2><p>For the Udacity Data Wrangling course, I downloaded the OpenStreetMaps data for my area, cleaned some aspects of the data in python and converted the XML data into JSON format. I inserted the JSON data into a MongoDB database and did some exploration of the user-entered information.</p>
<h2 class="project-tagline"><a href="http://grace-pehl.github.io/Subway-Rain/">Statistical analysis of rain's effect on NYC subway ridership</a></h2>
<p>This project for Udacity's Intro to Data Science course combined SQL queries of WeatherUnderground data with csv files from the New York Transit Authority.  The analysis was done in python using pandas and pandasql.</p>
 <h2 class="project-tagline"><a href="http://grace-pehl.github.io/NEI-Plots/">Exploratory Analysis of the EPA's National Emissions Inventory Data 1999-2008</a></h2>
	  <p> This project explored fine particulate matter emissions in the US using the R package dplyr for analysis and the different graphics packages in R: base, lattice, and ggplot2.  It was the second project for Exploratory Data Analysis.</p>
<h2 class="project-tagline"><a href="http://grace-pehl.github.io/Accelerometer-Tidy">Creating a tidy dataset of smartphone accelerometer readings</a></h2><p>Compiled text files into a single dataframe using dplyr package for R and output a tidy dataset ready for analysis.  Project for Getting and Cleaning Data course of Johns Hopkins data science specialization.</p>

	  <h2 class="project-tagline"><a href=" http://grace-pehl.github.io/Power-Usage">Exploration of Power Consumption Data</a></h2>
	  <p>Examined how household energy usage varied over a 2-day period in February, 2007, using the base plotting system in R.</p>
