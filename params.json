{"name":"Grace Pehl","tagline":"My Journey to Data Science","body":"### Have You Amazed Someone Today?\r\nI've always been an over-achiever.  Work hard, and see how far you can go.  From a tiny, rural high school, I went to Caltech.  After graduation, I finished a PhD in only 4 years.  And when it came time to start a family, I went all in.  Six children in 8 years, while my husband taught high school.  I homeschooled the children and ran a farm with cows, goats, turkeys, and 150 chickens.  I sold shares of our flock to start an egg CSA.  \r\n\r\n### A Passion for Analysis\r\nNow that the children are older, it makes more sense to have the teacher teach the children and the scientist go to work.  My thesis work developed Rietveld (least-squares) analysis procedures to determine preferred orientations (texture) of mineral crystals in rocks.  I worked with both image and text data taken from several different sources.  I loved taking in large amounts of data in often difficult formats and turning it into useful information.  It might take months of analysis and modeling to create a single graphic, but that graphic could show the strain history across an entire region.\r\n\r\n### From Scientist to Data Science\r\n[This GitHub site](github.com/grace-pehl) chronicles my growing knowledge of data science.  I am concurrently enrolled in the Data Analyst Nanodegree from Udacity and the specialization in data science offered by Johns Hopkins University and Coursera.  I plan to complete both programs in November.  I will also complete the specialization in project management through UC, Irvine in August and plan to take the CAPM exam afterwards. \r\n\r\n[![View Grace Pehl's profile on LinkedIn](https://static.licdn.com/scds/common/u/img/webpromo/btn_viewmy_160x33.png)](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/jenny-%22grace%22-pehl/a9/949/412)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
